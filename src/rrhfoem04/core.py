"""
Core implementation of the RRHFOEM04 RFID/NFC reader interface.

This module provides a Python interface for interacting with RRHFOEM04 RFID/NFC readers.
It supports multiple RFID protocols including ISO15693 and ISO14443A, implementing various
card operations such as inventory scanning, reading, and writing. The implementation
follows the manufacturer's protocol specification while adding robust error handling
and timing controls for reliable communication.

Key Features:
- Multiple protocol support (ISO15693, ISO14443A, Mifare)
- Automatic connection management
- Error handling and recovery
- Built-in timing controls for reliable communication
- Support for both single and multiple block operations

        Read multiple consecutive blocks from an ISO15693 tag in a single operation.
        
        This method implements an optimized multi-block read operation that:
        1. Reduces overall communication overhead compared to single block reads
        2. Maintains data consistency by reading blocks in one transaction
        3. Supports various addressing modes for different security needs
        
        The multi-block read process:
        1. Validates block numbers and counts
        2. Selects appropriate command mode (non-addressed/selected/addressed)
        3. Sends extended read command with block count
        4. Processes response containing multiple block data
        
        Memory Organization Note:
        ISO15693 tags typically organize memory in 4-byte blocks. When reading
        multiple blocks, the data is returned as a continuous sequence of blocks
        in little-endian format.
